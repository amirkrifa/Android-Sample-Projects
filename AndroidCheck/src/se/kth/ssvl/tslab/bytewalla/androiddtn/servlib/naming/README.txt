Class Not Implemented in Bytewalla Project from DTN2

The following Scheme we are not going to need and thus not created the template
class TCAScheme in TCAScheme.h because we will use only DTNScheeme 
class SessionScheme in SessionScheme.h because we will use only DTNScheeme
class EthernetScheme in EthernetScheme.h because we will use only DTNScheeme
class GlobalEndpointIDs in because it's for debugging according to comments
